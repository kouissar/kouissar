# Architecting Scalable AI & Performance-Driven Systems

👋 Hi, I’m Rafik Kouissar, a Senior Software Architect specializing in the intersection of **Generative AI**, **System Performance**, and **Cloud Infrastructure**. I focus on moving AI from "experimental scripts" to "production-grade systems."

### 🛠 Core Specializations
* **Agentic Orchestration:** Designing autonomous, multi-step agent workflows using Google ADK and LangChain.
* **Inference Optimization:** Architecting privacy-first, local LLM deployments (Ollama) with a focus on latency and throughput.
* **AWS Cloud Architecture:** Building scalable, resilient, and cost-effective AI environments using AWS-native services.

### 🚀 Key Projects
| Project | Domain | Core Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Maestro](https://github.com/kouissar/maestro-agentic)** | Agentic AI | Google ADK, Python, Orchestration Logic |
| **[Protocol Optimizer](https://github.com/kouissar/protocol-optimizer)** | Systems Logic | Python, Evidence-Based Data Modeling |
| **[AI Reflections](https://github.com/kouissar/AI-Reflections-Journal)** | Local AI | Ollama, Streamlit, NLP, Vector Embeddings |

### 🧠 Current Focus & Collaboration
* **Researching:** State-machine logic in Agentic workflows and RAG optimization patterns.
* **Collaborating:** Open to high-level discussions on **Machine Learning Architecture** and **System Performance Engineering**.
* **Passions:** Beyond the terminal, I am a musician and an avid hiker—disciplines that require the same rhythm and endurance as clean architecture.
